# Making a Pull Request
Although reading the [contribution guide](https://github.com/Jarmos-san/R_Notes/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) should be more than enough to make pull requests but regardless here is a template to follow before pushing a PR.

Top level links should be provided **CLEARLY** on the README.md file.

- Add New Notes
Write notes in Markdown`.md` so that GitHub can render it for easier readability within the browser and make sure to provide a link to it properly .
Format to follow:
```[notes name](link)```

- Changes to Notes
Make necessary changes in Markdown. Give a description(detailed, if possible) while making a commit.	

- Links to Reading materials(books)
Links(preferably the free and informative ones) to books that you would recommend to beginners for reading should be formatted in Markdown and pushed to the README.md file.
Format to follow:
```[name of the book](link)```

- Links to MOOCs/Online Courses
Links to MOOCs/Online Courses should be provided in Markdown format and pushed to the README.md file

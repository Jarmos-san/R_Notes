# R_Notes

**Clone it if you feel it's necessary but I keep adding more materials over time so make sure you come back to check it again!**

Brief notes on R programming collected from various resources thus this project is still a **Work-In-Progress**.

As the title and description already suggests that this is a small side project that I'be taken up mainly to help people like myself learning how to programme on the R software for **Data Analysis**. I hope that this work would prove out to be useful to someone else just the way it helped me. Feel free to add more information wherever deemed necessary. Would be extremely glad if PR it, I will definitely take it as a positive gesture.
